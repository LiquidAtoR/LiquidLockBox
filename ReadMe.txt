Hello User of my Repository.

You landed on the repository for LiquidLockBox.
LiquidLockBox is a plugin for HonorBuddy, a World of Warcraft bot.
This is a trivial little addon that opens and loot the lockboxes you gather.

Whenever you loot a lockbox, LiquidLockBox will kick in and open and loot the contents of the box.
This way your bags will not be flooded, and you might end up with a nice few items or gold.

Any bugs? Report em on the forums in the LiquidLockBox topic.

Thanks, LiquidAtoR.
